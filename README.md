# PoolShotPredictor
I have developed a project to joining the "Pool Shot Predictor" Contest by cvzone, which leverages machine learning techniques based on the YOLOv8 architecture to accurately detect the white ball, colored balls, and cue in a game of pool. The program then utilizes advanced image processing algorithms to select the green board and pool table, which are essential components for accurately predicting ball movement.

Leveraging object detection data acquired from YOLOv8, the program performs complex calculations to determine the precise position and direction of the pool ball's trajectory. Based on this information, the Pool Shot Predictor can predict with high accuracy whether the ball will successfully enter a pocket or not.

This project represents a sophisticated and highly effective approach to analyzing and predicting pool ball movement. By integrating cutting-edge machine learning and image processing technologies, the Pool Shot Predictor provides a highly accurate and valuable tool for improving gameplay, informing strategic decisions, and enhancing overall performance.
